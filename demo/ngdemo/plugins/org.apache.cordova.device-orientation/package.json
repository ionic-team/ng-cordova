The compass is a sensor\nthat detects the direction or heading that the device is pointed, typically\nfrom the top of the device.  It measures the heading in degrees from 0 to\n359.99, where 0 is north.\n\n## Installation\n\n    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.device-orientation\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\n- Amazon Fire OS\n- Android\n- BlackBerry 10\n- Firefox OS\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8 (if available in hardware)\n- Windows 8\n\n## Methods\n\n- navigator.compass.getCurrentHeading\n- navigator.compass.watchHeading\n- navigator.compass.clearWatch\n\n## navigator.compass.getCurrentHeading\n\nGet the current compass heading. The compass heading is returned via a `CompassHeading`\nobject using the `compassSuccess` callback function.\n\n    navigator.compass.getCurrentHeading(compassSuccess, compassError);\n\n### Example\n\n    function onSuccess(heading) {\n        alert('Heading: ' + heading.magneticHeading);\n    };\n\n    function onError(error) {\n        alert('CompassError: ' + error.code);\n    };\n\n    navigator.compass.getCurrentHeading(onSuccess, onError);\n\n## navigator.compass.watchHeading\n\nGets the device's current heading at a regular interval. Each time the heading\nis retrieved, the `headingSuccess` callback function is executed.\n\nThe returned watch ID references the compass watch interval. The watch\nID can be used with `navigator.compass.clearWatch` to stop watching the navigator.compass.\n\n    var watchID = navigator.compass.watchHeading(compassSuccess, compassError, [compassOptions]);\n\n`compassOptions` may contain the following keys:\n\n- __frequency__: How often to retrieve the compass heading in milliseconds. _(Number)_ (Default: 100)\n- __filter__: The change in degrees required to initiate a watchHeading success callback. When this value is set, __frequency__ is ignored. _(Number)_\n\n### Example\n\n    function onSuccess(heading) {\n        var element = document.getElementById('heading');\n        element.innerHTML = 'Heading: ' + heading.magneticHeading;\n    };\n\n    function onError(compassError) {\n        alert('Compass error: ' + compassError.code);\n    };\n\n    var options = {\n        frequency: 3000\n    }; // Update every 3 seconds\n\n    var watchID = navigator.compass.watchHeading(onSuccess, onError, options);\n\n\n### iOS Quirks\n\nOnly one `watchHeading` can be in effect at one time in iOS.  If a\n`watchHeading` uses a filter, calling `getCurrentHeading` or\n`watchHeading` uses the existing filter value to specify heading\nchanges. Watching heading changes with a filter is more efficient than\nwith time intervals.\n\n### Amazon Fire OS Quirks\n\n- `filter` is not supported.\n\n### Android Quirks\n\n- No support for `filter`.\n\n### Firefox OS Quirks\n\n- No support for `filter`.\n\n### Tizen Quirks\n\n- No support for `filter`.\n\n### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks\n\n- No support for `filter`.\n\n## navigator.compass.clearWatch\n\nStop watching the compass referenced by the watch ID parameter.\n\n    navigator.compass.clearWatch(watchID);\n\n- __watchID__: The ID returned by `navigator.compass.watchHeading`.\n\n### Example\n\n    var watchID = navigator.compass.watchHeading(onSuccess, onError, options);\n\n    // ... later on ...\n\n    navigator.compass.clearWatch(watchID);\n\n## CompassHeading\n\nA `CompassHeading` object is returned to the `compassSuccess` callback function.\n\n### Properties\n\n- __magneticHeading__: The heading in degrees from 0-359.99 at a single moment in time. _(Number)_\n\n- __trueHeading__: The heading relative to the geographic North Pole in degrees 0-359.99 at a single moment in time. A negative value indicates that the true heading can't be determined.  _(Number)_\n\n- __headingAccuracy__: The deviation in degrees between the reported heading and the true heading. _(Number)_\n\n- __timestamp__: The time at which this heading was determined.  _(milliseconds)_\n\n\n### Amazon Fire OS Quirks\n\n- `trueHeading` is not supported, but reports the same value as `magneticHeading`\n\n- `headingAccuracy` is always 0 because there is no difference between the `magneticHeading` and `trueHeading`\n\n### Android Quirks\n\n- The `trueHeading` property is not supported, but reports the same value as `magneticHeading`.\n\n- The `headingAccuracy` property is always 0 because there is no difference between the `magneticHeading` and `trueHeading`.\n\n### Firefox OS Quirks\n\n- The `trueHeading` property is not supported, but reports the same value as `magneticHeading`.\n\n- The `headingAccuracy` property is always 0 because there is no difference between the `magneticHeading` and `trueHeading`.\n\n### iOS Quirks\n\n- The `trueHeading` property is only returned for location services enabled via `navigator.geolocation.watchLocation()`.\n\n- For iOS 4 devices and above, heading factors in the device's current orientation, and does not reference its absolute position, for apps that supports that orientation.\n\n## CompassError\n\nA `CompassError` object is returned to the `compassError` callback function when an error occurs.\n\n### Properties\n\n- __code__: One of the predefined error codes listed below.\n\n### Constants\n\n- `CompassError.COMPASS_INTERNAL_ERR`\n- `CompassError.COMPASS_NOT_SUPPORTED`\n\n"
